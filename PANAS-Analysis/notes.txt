1- t = 0.087, p = 0.933
The difference between the math and speech groups is tiny (t ≈ 0) and completely consistent with random variation (p ≫ 0.05).

2- Stress was operationalized as change in Negative Affect; therefore, group differences were tested using ΔNA only.

3- The t-value tells you:
“How different are the average stress changes between the two groups, relative to the noise in the data?”

The math and speech groups showed almost identical changes in Negative Affect, and any tiny difference observed is completely consistent with random variation.

4- This code reshapes the data into long format, labels each score by time and affect type, and fits a mixed-effects model that tests whether stress (Negative Affect) changes differently over time in the math versus speech group while accounting for repeated measurements within participants.

5- Cohen’s d expresses the difference in stress change between math and speech in standard deviation units; here, d = −0.06 indicates a negligible, practically nonexistent effect.
