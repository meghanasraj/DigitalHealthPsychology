1- t = 0.087, p = 0.933
The difference between the math and speech groups is tiny (t ≈ 0) and completely consistent with random variation (p ≫ 0.05).

2- Stress was operationalized as change in Negative Affect; therefore, group differences were tested using ΔNA only.

3- The t-value tells you:
“How different are the average stress changes between the two groups, relative to the noise in the data?”

The math and speech groups showed almost identical changes in Negative Affect, and any tiny difference observed is completely consistent with random variation.

4- This code reshapes the data into long format, labels each score by time and affect type, and fits a mixed-effects model that tests whether stress (Negative Affect) changes differently over time in the math versus speech group while accounting for repeated measurements within participants.

5- Cohen’s d expresses the difference in stress change between math and speech in standard deviation units; here, d = −0.06 indicates a negligible, practically nonexistent effect.

questions: 
is delta N enough? or i should consider positive too?
do i have to consider age and sex about participants?


- short report: 
Positive and Negative Affect were assessed using the PANAS before and after the experimental task. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models with Time (pre vs. post) as a within-subject factor and Condition (math vs. speech) as a between-subject factor, including random intercepts for participants. Baseline analyses confirmed that the two groups did not differ in affect prior to the task.

For Negative Affect, the mixed-effects model showed no significant Time × Condition interaction, indicating that the change from pre to post did not differ between the math and speech conditions. As illustrated in figures, mean Negative Affect increased from pre to post in both groups. The vertical position of each point represents the group mean at each time point, while the connecting lines show the direction of change over time. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean, reflecting variability within each group. The largely parallel slopes for the two conditions indicate similar emotional responses across tasks. Consistent with this pattern, the effect size for group differences in change scores was negligible (Cohen’s d = −0.06).

A corresponding analysis of Positive Affect also revealed no significant Time × Condition interaction. Although Positive Affect showed a small decrease from pre to post in both groups, this change was comparable across conditions (Cohen’s d = 0.38). Overall, the results suggest that the math and speech tasks elicited similar emotional changes, with no evidence for a differential affective impact of task type in this sample.
